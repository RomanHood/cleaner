# cleaner
Clean nested repeated fields from a JSON document.

To download this repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:RomanHood/cleaner.git
cd cleaner
```
First run `bundle install` from your shell. This will enable you to run guard,
if you would like to, and enable pretty-looking output from the scipt
implementation.
```
To test the more mature implementation run:
```shell
rspec
```
Or
```shell
rspec spec/lib
```
From inside the project root directory. Either option will work just fine.
Running this will output documentation to your terminal explaining the functionality
of what was tested.

The code for this project lives in `<root>/lib/cleaner.rb`
